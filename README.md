2. Recreate the sample image output in Figma
3. Trial and error design by CSS
4. After the desktop design, proceeded to mobile viewing CSS styling

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox layout

### Continued development
This may be not the final solution because I'm still learning more about HTML and CSS. I want to practise more on the CSS layout especially the use of Flexbox and Grid layout.

### Useful resources
- [Learn CSS layout](https://learnlayout.com/box-sizing.html) - This helped me review the basics of CSS positioning.
